# full-stack-arxiv
I built a full stack web app for learning purposes.

## About

- I used an external API to seed the database; and
- I built a REST API to access the data from the front-end; and
- I built the front-end with React which renders the Data;


The data are research papers; I manipulate the **title** and the **abstract** of 
the research paper.
